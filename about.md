I'm Abi, a PhD student advised by Professor [Chris Manning](http://nlp.stanford.edu/manning/) in the [Stanford Natural Language Processing](http://nlp.stanford.edu/) group.
I aim to use this blog to communicate technical concepts in an accessible way.
There is more information about me on my [academic webpage](http://cs.stanford.edu/people/abisee/).
